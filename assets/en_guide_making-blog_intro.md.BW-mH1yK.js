For a blog, you can think of it as creating <code>one HTML file for each post</code>.</li><li>If you had to create each of these HTML files manually, it would be difficult to focus on writing content.</li><li>Therefore, there are various ways to create websites, and it’s best to develop them using a method that fits the type of web pages you want to create.</li><li>Since the <code>Quant-Haun blog</code> is a <code>simple, content-focused blog</code>, it only needs to generate HTML files in advance and show the same content to all visitors. No interaction is required, so a <code>Static Site</code> was chosen as the form.</li></ul></div><h3 id="what-is-a-static-site" tabindex="-1">What is a Static Site? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-static-site" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is a Static Site?&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Static Site</p><ul><li>A <code>Static Site</code> is a website made up of only <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>JavaScript</code>.</li><li>Unlike <code>dynamic sites</code>, which change the web page based on user actions, a <code>static site</code> always displays the same content without any interaction from the user.

It then combines these to generate <code>pre-built HTML files</code> that the server only needs to host.</li><li>There are various static site generators based on different programming languages. One of the most commonly used is <code>Jekyll</code>, which is based on <code>Ruby</code>, and <code>Gatsby</code>, which is based on <code>React</code>.</li><li>Although less widely used, there are <code>VuePress</code> and <code>VitePress</code>, both of which are based on <code>Vue</code>. These are great for building simple websites, and since <code>Vue</code> plans to continue supporting <code>VitePress</code>, I decided to use it for creating the blog.</li><li>The method for creating a static site with <code>VitePress</code> will be introduced in the next post.</li></ul></div><h2 id="server-for-hosting-the-site" tabindex="-1">Server for Hosting the Site <a class="header-anchor" href="#server-for-hosting-the-site" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Server for Hosting the Site&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Hosting Server</p><ul><li>Once you’ve created your site using a static site generator, you’ll need a <code>server</code> to host it.</li><li>You could host the site by setting up a server computer at home or by using paid hosting services, but for a small personal blog, free hosting options are available.</li><li>One such option that provides free hosting services is <code>GitHub Pages</code>.</li></ul></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">GitHub Pages</p><ul><li><code>GitHub Pages</code> allows you to host one site for <code>free</code> as long as you have a <code>GitHub account</code>.</li><li>By creating a <code>repository</code> on <code>GitHub</code> and uploading your built site, you can access it through the URL <code>[GitHubID].github.io</code>. For example, the address of the <code>Quant-Haun blog</code> is <code>quant-haun.github.io</code>, where <code>quant-haun</code> is my <code>GitHub ID</code>.</li><li>There’s no need to install anything, and the traffic limit is sufficient for a personal blog, making it a very convenient service.</li><li><code>GitHub Pages</code> provides the <code>Jekyll</code> static site generator by default. If you create your site with <code>Jekyll + GitHub Pages</code>, you can simply add posts and upload them to GitHub, and GitHub will automatically build and generate the site. This combination is ideal for personal blogs due to its simplicity.</li><li>However, you can still use GitHub Pages for free hosting with other static site generators. So, feel free to use any generator that suits your needs.</li><li>The <code>Quant-Haun blog</code> was built using <code>VitePress</code> and is hosted on <code>GitHub Pages</code>.</li><li>The process of setting up a domain and deploying with GitHub Pages will be explained in the next post.</li></ul></div>',19)]))}const b=t(s,[["render",l]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
