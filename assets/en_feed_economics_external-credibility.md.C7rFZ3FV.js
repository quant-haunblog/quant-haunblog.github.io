Higher and steadier growth rates are viewed positively in credibility evaluations.</li><li><strong>Fiscal Soundness</strong>: The government‚Äôs debt ratio and management capabilities are key evaluation criteria. Excessive debt increases credit risk, while an appropriate debt level and efficient management enhance trustworthiness.</li><li><strong>Foreign Exchange Reserves</strong>: These indicate a country&#39;s ability to stabilize the foreign exchange market and respond to external shocks. Ample reserves reduce the likelihood of currency crises and contribute to higher credibility.</li><li><strong>Trade Balance</strong>: The trade balance represents the economic gains a country generates through international trade. A sustained trade surplus indicates consistent foreign currency inflows and stable economic growth, positively influencing credit ratings.</li></ul></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">2Ô∏è‚É£ Political Factors</p><ul><li><strong>Political Stability</strong>: A stable environment where the government can implement policies consistently is essential for maintaining credibility.

Countries with high credit ratings are perceived as stable investment destinations, encouraging active foreign investments. As foreign investment increases, <code>a steady inflow of foreign currency helps maintain stable exchange rates.</code> For example, after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, South Korea substantially increased its foreign exchange reserves, maintaining high credibility and successfully reducing exchange rate volatility.</p><p>Nations with high credit ratings can <code>borrow money at lower interest rates, greatly reducing funding costs.</code> This lessens fiscal burdens and allows governments to allocate funds efficiently to critical areas such as infrastructure, welfare, and technological development‚Äîdriving economic growth. On the other hand, countries with lower credit ratings are considered high-risk for investments, forcing them to borrow at higher interest rates. This leads to increased financial burdens and a higher likelihood of economic crises. South Korea, maintaining an AA rating, has been able to secure low-interest financing and invest in key sectors like education, welfare, and infrastructure.</p><p>High external credibility also serves as a <code>significant advantage in trade and diplomatic negotiations.</code> South Korea has maintained a stable and high credit rating from international credit agencies, establishing itself as a trustworthy partner in major trade agreements and investment initiatives. This credibility has bolstered its negotiation power in agreements such as the Korea-U.S. FTA, enabling the country to secure favorable terms based on its reputation as a reliable partner.</p>',9)),a(t),e[2]||(e[2]=i('<h2 id="the-evolution-of-south-korea-s-external-credibility" tabindex="-1">The Evolution of South Korea‚Äôs External Credibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-evolution-of-south-korea-s-external-credibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Evolution of South Korea‚Äôs External Credibility&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><h3 id="the-asian-financial-crisis-and-the-credibility-crisis" tabindex="-1">The Asian Financial Crisis and the Credibility Crisis <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-asian-financial-crisis-and-the-credibility-crisis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Asian Financial Crisis and the Credibility Crisis&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>The 1997 Asian financial crisis highlighted the critical importance of external credibility for the South Korean economy. At the time, South Korea faced a significant downgrade in its national credit rating due to factors such as excessive short-term debt, insufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a lack of transparency in the financial system. Leading credit rating agencies like S&amp;P and Moody&#39;s downgraded South Korea‚Äôs rating to speculative grade, triggering a massive outflow of foreign capital and economic turmoil.</p><p>Following the IMF bailout, <code>South Korea succeeded in restoring its credibility by improving its economic structure and implementing reforms.</code> The government significantly increased foreign exchange reserves, strengthened fiscal soundness, and enhanced financial system transparency. As a result, South Korea regained its pre-crisis credit rating levels, achieving an <code>AA rating from S&amp;P in 2012, marking advanced-nation-level trust.</code></p><h3 id="the-global-financial-crisis-and-defending-credibility" tabindex="-1">The Global Financial Crisis and Defending Credibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-global-financial-crisis-and-defending-credibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Global Financial Crisis and Defending Credibility&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>During the 2008 global financial crisis, South Korea demonstrated resilience by maintaining its external credibility.

Despite the political turmoil, <code>South Korea maintained its credit rating thanks to economic stability and institutional reliability.</code> This resilience is one of the key reasons why the South Korean economy is internationally trusted.</p><h2 id="december-3rd-the-martial-law-declaration-and-external-credibility" tabindex="-1">December 3rd: The Martial Law Declaration and External Credibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#december-3rd-the-martial-law-declaration-and-external-credibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;December 3rd: The Martial Law Declaration and External Credibility&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>On December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol&#39;s declaration of a state of emergency stirred significant domestic and international concern.

Moody‚Äôs also warned that &quot;if political tensions persist, it could negatively affect South Korea‚Äôs credit rating and domestic assets.&quot; However, concerns over prolonged political unrest were somewhat eased following the passage of an impeachment motion against President Yoon on December 14, reducing fears of a prolonged impeachment crisis.</p><h3 id="the-swift-response-of-financial-authorities" tabindex="-1">The Swift Response of Financial Authorities <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-swift-response-of-financial-authorities" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Swift Response of Financial Authorities&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Following the December 3rd martial law declaration, <code>the South Korean government took a series of measures to stabilize the financial markets.</code> The Bank of Korea purchased over 10 trillion won worth of repurchase agreements (RPs) daily to inject liquidity into the market.
