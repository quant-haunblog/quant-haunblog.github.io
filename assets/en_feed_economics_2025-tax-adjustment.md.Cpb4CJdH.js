However, this doesn’t always mean a refund. If the adjustment shows you underpaid, you may owe additional taxes.</p><p>It is a necessary process because tax rates differ based on individual circumstances. For example, someone earning ₩3 million monthly who lives alone (Person A) would pay different taxes than someone earning the same but supporting a family of three (Person B).</p><h3 id="🏢-taxes-already-withheld-withholding-tax" tabindex="-1">🏢 Taxes Already Withheld: Withholding Tax <a class="header-anchor" href="#🏢-taxes-already-withheld-withholding-tax" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;🏢 Taxes Already Withheld: Withholding Tax&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Your paycheck likely shows taxes already withheld by the government, known as <code>withholding tax.</code> This amount doesn’t consider personal income, spending patterns, or dependents.
