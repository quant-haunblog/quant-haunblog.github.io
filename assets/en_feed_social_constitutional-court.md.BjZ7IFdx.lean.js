Deliberation involves examining the specific details of the case and determining whether the impeachment is justified.</p><h2 id="_2️⃣-principles-and-legal-framework" tabindex="-1">2️⃣ Principles and Legal Framework <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2️⃣-principles-and-legal-framework" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2️⃣ Principles and Legal Framework&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Constitutional Court&#39;s deliberation of a presidential impeachment case is grounded in core democratic principles, such as the separation of powers, rule of law, and constitutional safeguarding. Presidential impeachment serves as a critical mechanism to prevent abuse of power and restore public trust. The legal basis and procedures for this process are summarized as follows:</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Article 65 of the Constitution</p><ul><li>If the president violates the Constitution or the law, the National Assembly may initiate impeachment by a motion supported by at least one-third of its members and passed by a majority vote. Once passed, the president&#39;s duties are suspended, and the Constitutional Court assumes the responsibility for final adjudication.</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Article 23 of the Constitutional Court Act</p><ul><li>To deliberate on impeachment cases, the participation of at least seven justices is generally required. However, due to the current vacancy of three positions, the court is functioning with six justices. Concerns were raised about whether deliberation is possible under such circumstances, but the court has temporarily suspended this requirement through an injunction, enabling deliberation with six justices.</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Requirements for Impeachment Decisions</p><ul><li>A minimum of six justices must agree to reach a decision on impeachment. This stringent standard ensures the legitimacy and fairness of decisions involving the removal of a head of state.</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Interim Measures and Legitimacy Concerns</p><ul><li>Although deliberations can proceed with six justices, deciding on an issue as significant as presidential impeachment with fewer than nine justices may lead to legitimacy disputes. Some suggest it would be prudent to appoint new justices to fill the vacancies before proceeding. However, appointing new justices requires agreement from the National Assembly, which could delay proceedings due to political conflicts.</li></ul></div><h2 id="_3️⃣-implications" tabindex="-1">3️⃣ Implications <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3️⃣-implications" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3️⃣ Implications&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Deliberating with six justices may raise questions about the legitimacy and fairness of the decision, as significant cases like presidential impeachment are ideally handled by the full bench of nine justices. Delays in appointing new justices could postpone deliberations and decisions, exacerbating national uncertainty. On the other hand, swift deliberation could minimize the governmental vacuum.</p><h2 id="_4️⃣-comparison-with-related-terms" tabindex="-1">4️⃣ Comparison with Related Terms <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4️⃣-comparison-with-related-terms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4️⃣ Comparison with Related Terms&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Impeachment Motion</strong><br> A resolution by the National Assembly requesting the suspension of presidential duties for alleged violations of the law</li><li><strong>Suspension of Duties</strong><br> A measure that temporarily halts the president’s exercise of authority following the passage of an impeachment motion</li><li><strong>Treason</strong><br> A crime involving acts of rebellion aimed at overthrowing the national order</li></ul>',12))])}const y=a(u,[["render",d]]);export{w as __pageData,y as default};
