All notes created by the user are <code>saved as Markdown files in local folders</code>, ensuring excellent data ownership and security. It also offers a <code>Graph View</code> that allows users to build a knowledge network through <code>linking between notes</code> and visually understand the relationships between them. This connection-focused structure is effective not only for organizing notes but also for expanding thoughts and building deep knowledge.</p><p>For example, while note-taking apps like Evernote or Notion may struggle with managing an increasing number of notes due to a lack of linking concepts, Obsidian provides features such as <code>note linking, tags, and a visual graph view</code> to systematically organize and connect information. These features help users easily navigate complex ideas and information, recognize relationships among them, and think from new perspectives.</p><p>Although other note apps like Roam Research, Upnote, and Logseq offer similar concepts, Obsidian stands out with its <code>customizable flexibility, local file-based data management, and a rich plugin ecosystem</code>.</p><h2 id="_2Ô∏è‚É£-history-of-obsidian" tabindex="-1">2Ô∏è‚É£ History of Obsidian <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2Ô∏è‚É£-history-of-obsidian" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2Ô∏è‚É£ History of Obsidian&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Obsidian was launched in 2020 by two developers, Shida Li and Erica Xu. They aimed to create a connection-based knowledge management tool that existing note apps could not provide.</p><p>Since its launch, Obsidian has rapidly expanded its features by reflecting diverse user feedback and has gained significant popularity, especially among developers and professional communities. Currently, it is available <code>for free for personal use</code> and also offers <code>paid plans for teams and businesses</code>.</p><h2 id="_3Ô∏è‚É£-key-features-of-obsidian" tabindex="-1">3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features of Obsidian <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3Ô∏è‚É£-key-features-of-obsidian" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features of Obsidian&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p><a href="https://obsidian.md/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Manifesto on Obsidian&#39;s Core Principles</a></p><h3 id="_1-markdown-based-writing" tabindex="-1">‚ë† Markdown-Based Writing <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-markdown-based-writing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;‚ë† Markdown-Based Writing&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>You can quickly and efficiently take notes using the <code>simple and intuitive</code> Markdown syntax.
