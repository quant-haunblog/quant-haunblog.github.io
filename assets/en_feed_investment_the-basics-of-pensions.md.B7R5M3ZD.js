The age varies depending on the individual’s year of birth. The amount received is determined by the member’s income and contribution period.</p><p>A key feature of the National Pension is its inflation adjustment mechanism, which increases payouts based on rising prices. Pension income is recalibrated to the current monetary value of the individual’s contributions.
