An interest rate hike can also cause stock prices to fall and the exchange rate to drop, while a rate cut can lead to the opposite effect.</li><li>However, these are theoretical effects, and actual economic outcomes may differ significantly.

Conversely, when the base rate falls, market interest rates also decline, and this effect is often deliberately induced. However, since the base rate is merely a target rate, actual market interest rates are determined by the supply and demand of funds.</li><li>The Bank of Korea influences inflation and money supply directly through monetary policies such as bond trading and adjustments to reserve requirements or the rediscount rate. Additionally, financial institutions, including commercial banks, reference the base rate when setting their interest rates.</li><li>Therefore, it is common for market interest rates to rise when the base rate rises and for market rates to fall when the base rate falls. Although the Bank of Korea‚Äôs base rate directly impacts domestic bank interest rates, changes in the U.S. Federal Reserve‚Äôs base rate significantly influence the Bank of Korea‚Äôs decisions. This is due to the need to manage large-scale capital inflows or outflows in response to changes in the U.S. base rate.</li></ul></div>',17))])}const k=i(l,[["render",d]]);export{y as __pageData,k as default};
