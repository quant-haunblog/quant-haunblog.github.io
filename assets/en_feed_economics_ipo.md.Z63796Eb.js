It signifies a company&#39;s official listing on the stock market. Once listed, the company is required to disclose internal information, such as financial reports, making the term &quot;corporate disclosure&quot; apt. Shares of companies that have gone through an IPO can be traded on stock markets like KOSPI, KOSDAQ, or NASDAQ.</p><h2 id="why-do-companies-conduct-ipos" tabindex="-1">Why do companies conduct IPOs? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-do-companies-conduct-ipos" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why do companies conduct IPOs?&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Why do companies opt for an IPO? The biggest reason is capital raising. Typically, IPOs are conducted by issuing new shares, which investors purchase. Companies can raise capital equivalent to the product of the share price and the number of shares issued. Therefore, an IPO acts as a growth driver for companies aiming for significant expansion. Additionally, being listed on the stock market enhances the company‚Äôs reputation as an official and large-scale enterprise.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Advantages of IPO</p><ul><li><strong>Capital raising</strong>: Enables large-scale funding for business expansion, research and development, or debt repayment.</li><li><strong>Liquidity for investors</strong>: Provides an opportunity for early investors or founders to sell their shares and recover their investment.</li><li><strong>Enhanced credibility</strong>: Improves transparency and trustworthiness of the company through public listing.</li></ul></div><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Disadvantages of IPO</p><ul><li><strong>High costs</strong>: Significant expenses incurred during preparation and execution of an IPO.</li><li><strong>Mandatory disclosure</strong>: Sensitive business strategies may be exposed due to public disclosure requirements.</li><li><strong>Increased management burden</strong>: Pressure to meet shareholders&#39; interests may lead to a focus on short-term performance.</li></ul></div><h2 id="ipo-process" tabindex="-1">IPO Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#ipo-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;IPO Process&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The IPO process is longer and more complex than it might seem. Let&#39;s break it down step by step.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">1Ô∏è‚É£ Preliminary Listing Review</p><ul><li>Companies planning an IPO must first select an underwriter (usually a securities firm) to assist in the process. They also refine internal structures by improving financial frameworks and strengthening internal controls.</li><li>The company then prepares for and applies for a preliminary listing review in collaboration with the underwriter. Passing this review, managed by the stock exchange, grants the company the qualification to proceed with an IPO.</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">2Ô∏è‚É£ Filing a Securities Registration Statement</p><ul><li>Next, the company files a securities registration statement to attract investors. This document contains key information such as the company‚Äôs revenue and business operations, helping investors understand the company.</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">3Ô∏è‚É£ Demand Forecasting</p><ul><li>After filing the statement, the company conducts a demand forecast targeting institutional investors. For example, institutions like pension funds are asked how much they are willing to pay for and how many shares they are interested in buying. The company provides a tentative offering price range, often referred to as the price band (e.g., $50‚Äì$70).</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">4Ô∏è‚É£ Determining the Offering Price</p><ul><li>At the end of the demand forecasting period, the company determines the final offering price based on factors like the price range desired by institutions and the level of competition for shares. For instance, if most institutions indicate $70 and the competition is high, the company might set the price at the top of the band ($70).</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">5Ô∏è‚É£ Public Subscription</p><ul><li>Once the offering price is finalized, the company begins the public subscription phase, where individual investors can subscribe to the company‚Äôs shares through a securities firm.</li></ul></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">6Ô∏è‚É£ Listing and Trading</p><ul><li>On the designated date, the company‚Äôs shares are listed on the stock market, allowing investors to freely buy and sell shares.</li></ul></div>',14)),s(t),e[4]||(e[4]=o('<h2 id="understanding-public-subscription-for-ipos" tabindex="-1">Understanding Public Subscription for IPOs <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-public-subscription-for-ipos" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Understanding Public Subscription for IPOs&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>When a company conducts an IPO, it simultaneously facilitates public subscription, a process where new shares are issued, and investors are allocated these shares. IPO companies often have significant growth potential, making public subscription highly attractive to investors. Individual investors can participate in public subscription through two main methods.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">1Ô∏è‚É£ Proportional Allocation System</p><ul><li>The first method is the proportional allocation system, where shares are allocated in proportion to the subscription deposit. For example, if Person A deposits $100,000, they might receive 100 shares, while Person B, depositing $10,000, might receive 10 shares. However, this system has been criticized for favoring wealthy investors who can dominate the allocation by depositing large sums.</li></ul></div><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">üí° Subscription Deposit</p><ul><li>The amount of money submitted to participate in the public subscription. For instance, with a 50% deposit rate, submitting a $1,000 deposit allows a $2,000 subscription.</li></ul></div><div class="danger custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">2Ô∏è‚É£ Equal Allocation System</p><ul><li>The second method is the equal allocation system, where all investors who meet the minimum deposit requirement receive an equal number of shares. For example, if the minimum deposit is $10, Investor A and Investor B would receive the same number of shares regardless of their respective deposits of $500 or $1,000. Currently, companies are required to allocate at least 50% of the shares equally to ensure fairness.</li></ul></div><p>In the past, some investors exploited this system by opening accounts at multiple securities firms or using family members‚Äô names to maximize their allocations. This practice, known as overlapping subscriptions, was prohibited by the government in June 2021 to align with the equal allocation system‚Äôs intent. Now, investors can receive shares from only one securities firm.</p><h2 id="ipo-public-subscription-faqs" tabindex="-1">IPO &amp; Public Subscription FAQs <a class="header-anchor" href="#ipo-public-subscription-faqs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;IPO &amp; Public Subscription FAQs&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><h3 id="q-what-does-·ÑÑ·Ö°·Ñâ·Ö°·Üº-mean-in-ipos" tabindex="-1">Q.
